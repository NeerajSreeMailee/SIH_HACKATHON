Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FSKWS) Project

Overview

The Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FSKWS) project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately detecting keywords in audio snippets using minimal training data. The model leverages advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, embedding networks for representation learning, and similarity matching to classify keywords based on a few examples.

Features

	•	Few-Shot Learning: Ability to learn from a small number of labeled examples for efficient keyword detection.
	•	Audio Feature Extraction: Utilizes CNNs to extract meaningful features from audio signals, enhancing performance.
	•	Similarity Matching: Compares new audio inputs to reference keywords using various similarity measures, ensuring accuracy.
	•	Optional Attention Mechanism: Focuses on relevant sections of audio to improve detection performance, reducing the influence of noise.
	•	3D Visualization: Interactive 3D representation of the model architecture for a clearer understanding of its components.

Architecture

The architecture of the Few-Shot Keyword Spotting model consists of the following key components:

Backbone Network

	•	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
	•	Extracts audio features from input signals using log-mel spectrograms or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
	•	CNN layers capture local patterns in audio signals, such as phonemes or syllables, through convolutional filters.
	•	The extracted features retain both temporal and spectral properties essential for recognizing keywords.

Embedding Network

	•	Maps high-dimensional audio features into a lower-dimensional embedding space.
	•	Goal: Ensure that similar audio snippets (utterances of the same keyword) have embeddings that are close together, while different keywords have embeddings that are distant in this space.
	•	This encoding compresses rich feature data into a more manageable representation for classification.

Similarity Matching Layer

	•	Computes similarity between the embedding of the query audio (new input) and reference embeddings (provided keyword examples).
	•	Common similarity measures include:
	•	Euclidean Distance: Measures the distance between embeddings in the space.
	•	Cosine Similarity: Measures the angle between embedding vectors, capturing directional relationships.
	•	Keywords with high similarity scores to the query embeddings are classified as detected keywords.

Attention Mechanism

	•	(Optional) An attention mechanism focuses on important parts of the input audio (e.g., relevant syllables) and reduces the influence of irrelevant sections (e.g., background noise).

Support for Few-Shot Learning

	•	The model is designed to learn from a small set of examples for each new keyword.
	•	Reference embeddings are computed from a small number of labeled examples, allowing the model to compare these with the embedding of the query audio during inference.

Installation
